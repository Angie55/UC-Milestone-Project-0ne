# Homemade Beauty

Homemade beauty is a website focused on natural skin care that can easily made at home using very simple ingredients. 
Each ingredient is natural, either in it’s whole form or with very little modification.  The primary goal of the website 
is to give users an introduction to how easy it is make their own products for their beauty/cleansing routine.
Users can read more about why it’s good to go natural as well as see a range of recipes organised into categories. Each 
recipe page has a clear list in ingredients and how they are good for skin. There is also a video to accompany each recipe,
which makes the experience feel more interactive.The site also gives creators a opportunity to feature on the website and share new recipes.

### Developer goals

-	To create a clean, easy to navigate website that appeals to users interested in natural skincare.
-	To make the idea of homemade products look simple and easy to include in their routine.
-	A first attempt at leaning how to create a site based on an original idea, learning a lot along the way to improve on future projects management.

-	Information on ingredients
-	Links to bloggers and vloggers that create content I could be interested in.
-	Videos of how to make a homemade product.
-	Affordable alternatives to ready made products

## UX

**Target client**

Women aged 25-50 who most likely already try to eat clean and are conscious of chemicals in everyday products. Other motives include years of expensive 
skin products that have not effect and looking for a more environmentally friendly option. The client may be searching online for brands that sell products which 
they claim to be all natural and want to explore if it is easy to DIY simliar products with good results.


**Client story**

As a visitor to the website I want:

-	A clean simple design that fits the aesthetic of natural and clean products.
-	Easy navigation in main menu and pages to explore recipes.
-	Information to clarify why I would switch to natural products.
-	Well-organised recipes to find something that suits me.
-	More than one choice for each product type.
-	Ability to flip back and forth easily between recipes in a certain category to establish which would be more beneficial for me.
-	Information about each ingredient and its benefits.
-	Information and links about each creator so I can see more of their work
-	An easy to follow guide to making each recipes as well as videos to see the process in action.
-	A way to contact and get involved if I am already make my own products.


**Design choices**

The overall feeling of the website is to look clean and simple like many skincare companies use but with a slightly more organic, natural feeling. 

-	Round corners- this gives a softer, natural feel to the clean design so it does not look too clinical.
-	Colours- the main three colours used where a green, orange and grey. The green give a clean and natural feel while the orange adds a pop of colour,
	as you would find in nature. During my research most of the well-designed natural health blogs used a couple of bright colours on a predominantly 
	white website.
-	Font- Raleway has a elegant feel that is quite modern. It compliments the general feel but still works well alongside natural products and imagery. Roboto
	is an easy to read, firendly font that works very well with most fonts and is recommended as a top match for Raleway.
-	Imagery- recipe images focus on shots of simple ingredients that can be easily recognised and finished products that look familiar as a skin care product.
-	Headers and other imagery across the site uses flowers and the sea which work with the natural theme of the site. An image of each vlogger that the user will 
	see or hear in the video features on eah recipe page to create a familiar feeling.
-	Transitions- these are smooth for calm, natural feel. The main navigation feature a line that grows that I felt gave a good experience as the growing line 
	fits that natural feel while giving clear feedback that they are hovering over the link. 
-	Button and social transitions reverse the colour for clear feedback that the user can click and go somewhere.
-	Max-width of 80% on larger screens gives the content a neater look while still allowing imagery to be large and bold.

## Features

Each page has the same navigation bar that features a logo and the main navigation. This is a familiar layout so the users know where they are at all times and can 
easily navigate around the site.  Users can easily go between recipes, reading about why the site was created and the contact form.

Each page also has a footer, currently it has a disclaimer where a copyright information would be.

Each page, except contact us which has minimal scrolling even on a mobile, has a ‘back to top’ link. This is most useful on smaller screen where there is quite a bit
of scrolling but I kept if on all sizes as it assists in moving around the site easily.

All the main pages other than the homepage have a banner that has nature inspired imagery and a bold title. This allows the user to easily know where they are at all 
times. The imagery gives a natural feel and is slightly muted by a green overlay to put the focus on the text.

**Main navigation**

On a large screen the main navigation has a fairly common, predictable layout. The logo always goes the homepage when clicked and the main pages are clearly listed. 
The active page is bold so it is clear where you are and a growing line, hover effect make it feel interactive in a subtle way. 

The drop down menu hover effect is kept simple so there is not too much going on with all the options. A shadow effect was added to make it stand out a little bit more 
on the white background.

For smaller screens the main menu options becomes a burger menu that toggles to the main menu page options and the sub menu options.

**Home**

This features a large hero image that would fit well on any general skin care site so there is immediately a familiar feel. The image is fixed so it looks like you 
scroll over it for a clean modern feel. Information is visible that leads to bold images that link to recipes so users have the choice to go straight to what they are 
most likely looking for. The page scrolls over a fixed background image that fits the theme and feel. Then users are given the choice to read about the site and make contact. 
The main menu options are available on the page so if the user choose to scroll down the homepage rather that go straight to the menu they can still start navigating and exploring the
content and it will still make sense as they start using the main navigation.

The responsive design uses the same method as the face and body recipe pages. For smaller screen sizes each image/link goes onto a single line so the images and text 
remain bold and clear.

**About Us**


This begins with an introduction about the purpose of the website so the user can get a clear idea of what it is about. The introduction includes a call to action for anyone
interested in sharing a recipe. 
The rest of the about us gives further details as to why it’s a good idea to go natural and gives some good reasons.  A short video gives more detail of what to avoid. This 
page gives the user a chance to learn more and a reason to explore the website and it’s content.

**Face and Body recipe pages**

The sections are separated into product types to make it easier for the user to view the selection.  A bold image gives the user a glimpse of the natural ingredients.
For smaller screens each image and title block is the full width and users scroll down.

**Individual recipe pages**

Each recipe page has a link to all other recipe of that type at the top of the page. The current page is clearly highlighted and clicking on it will scroll down the page 
so you only see the recipe. This design feature is to help users flip between recipes pages easily as they decide which recipe will work best for them. Originally the plan
was for this to display as tabs on larger screen but keeping the button display looked better as it fit the design and flow of the site.

The title clearly states which recipe the user is on and starts with an introduction to the creator.  Each intro has a link to their YouTube channel or blog so users can
explore the individual further if they choose. They also have some familiarity with the person they will see or hear in the video.

The ingredients and instructions section is kept very simple to make it clear how simple each recipe is to make and how few ingredients are involved. A small leaf icon 
replaces the bullet points for a fun addition to the simplistic page. Each ingredients has a brief explanation of it’s benefits to the skin. The measurement and ingredient
are in bold for quick reading, while the reader scans over it is clear how simple the recipe is. 

Responsive ingredients and instructions sections- on a larger screen this is within one block as with the larger space this looked better with it all together and connected. 
On smaller screens, as the text is more spread out with more scrolling the section looked better separated. I believe more complicated version of this will come up in my 
future career so it was good to learn how to implement it in this simple form for now.

After reading about the recipe and method the users can then watch the video of how to make and use it.

**Contact us**

I brief introduction explains that we are looking to feature more creators and there is a form to fill in. The form checks that all fields are filled and lets the user know what they have missed or need to correct.

**Footer**

The social links go to a range of the creators whose recipes I used. A disclaimer is used where copyright would usually be to make it clear the content was used for 
educational purposes.


**Features to implement in the future**

Setting the contact form up to send the information somewhere and give feedback that it has been submitted.

As more recipes and creators are added there could be more sections added so there is a wider range to cover all steps of most people’s beauty/cleansing routine.

Some of the main ingredients could have an affiliate link or be sold through the website as well as items to mix and store the products.

The addition of approximate costing per recipe to compare to purchased skincare.

## Testing

### Client goals/journey testing

Clients can:

- Easily figure out what the site is about.
- Navigate easily as the navigation and movement throughout the website is predictable.
- Find out more on the reasons for the website.
- Recognise the aesthetic of a health and beauty website.
- Easily find the well organised recipes. 
- They have options and an easy way to navigate between recipes. They can flip between recipes easily as well as easily get back to where they were.
- Easily watch videos on every recipe page.
- They can find out more about each vlogger with a link in the intro which does not take them away from the site.
- See the same layout on each recipe page so become comfortable and familar quickly as they know what to expect.
- They can see how basic the recipes are at a quick glance on the individual recipe pages. 
- They can see information on each ingredient to tell the user why it’s good.
- They can use the back to top link to quickly go back up.
- They get good clear feedback when hovering over navigation, buttons and links.
- They can make contact and get feedback if they miss anything out on the form.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing was carried out on every page to test:

- Navigation links
- Page links
- Recipe button links
- Social media links

Buttons and links hover effects were tested to ensure all transitions and changes were working.

All images and the favicon loaded on each page. The images are responsive. 

All pages are fully responsive and resize with all correct positioning and spacing. The set up using bootstrap grid and media queries works well.

Page content was proofed to check content made sense and there were no grammatical errors I am aware of.

The form on the contact us page will not allow the user to submit unless all sections are filled correctly and gives feedback as to errors or what has been missed.



### Cross browser/device testing

**iMac 21.5inch screen**- 

- Chrome- resizing the screen from the smallest to largest size. Also using the developer tools to check site all devices available in portrait and landscape mode.

- Safari – resizing the screen from the smallest to largest size.

- Firefox- resizing the screen from the smallest to largest size. Also using Firefox developer tools to view site on all available devices in portrait and landscape.

**iPhone 5SE**– 
- Safari and Chrome- portrait and landcape.

Checked site across several versions of browsers on [Browserly](https://www.browserling.com/)

### Issues found and resolved -

Alot of testing was done as the project was built so most issues were generally resolved along the way.

On all tablets I found that the ingredients and method sections on the individual recipes pages were displaying both the large and small screen version between 810px and 991px. I corrected this by amending the size the media query for larger screens should begin.

The h1 in the header images on each page on smaller devices when landscape were too large. I changed the em sizing to vh and the header sizes.

Found the word Scrubs missing the 'c' in the main navigation under recipes when in the 2nd and 3rd face cleansers recipe pages. I corrected both pages and committed the changes.


### Left to resolve-

The hero image and image half way down the homepage seem to resize well and look good on Firefox and Chrome developer tools when set to iPhone5 but when the site is open on my iPhone 5SE they are so large that you can’t see them.
This is an issue I will have to look into after submission, as I need to submit this project.

There seems to be some no margin on the right and left of the homepage when it is viewed in Chrome developer tools as an iPad or iPad Pro. It appears to display fine on these devices in Firefox. This will require further testing.
